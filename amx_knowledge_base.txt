Why Our Clinicians And Healthcare Partners Choose AMX
I have been traveling for over a year and have had a few recruiters in my short time on my new adventure. What I like  best about AMX healthcare is my recruiter, Benjamin. As you know contracts are for a limited amount of time. So, it’s very important that you have a good relationship with your recruiter. Benjamin is always easy to reach. He is always just a  phone call or a text message away. He is professional, polite, considerate, and caring. Benjamin is for his team!!! He does not hesitate to look into a situation, and he always has your best interest. One of our biggest complaints as employees is communication with our employers. If you’re like me, you’re not just looking for temporary employment, but you want a good relationship with the people that you work with for longevity. I want good communication and I get that with AMX Healthcare. My recruiter is better than yours; however, I’m sharing. Come join our team.
Jayne Lee
This is one of the most professional agencies that I have worked with. My recruiter goes above and beyond. He checks on me weekly and handles any issue that I may have very quickly.
Nikeba Dumas
I had a great experience with AMX and will for sure acquire work through them in the future. My recruiter, Benjamin is the best of all I’ve work with, responds promptly, cares, and is always willing to look for the best assignment that works for me. Thank you!
Jouhanna Austin
Leandro was awesome. The onboarding was quick and easy. Best experience ever with any company I have ever worked with. His response time was on point to my liking. Excited for my first contract assignment.
Gwen Kemp
Great agency. I love Ben and he is an amazing recruiter.
Yonna Bellemy
Leandro was very helpful and answered all my questions. If I had a concern, he addressed it quickly. The onboarding process was easy, and he took the time to explain the requirements and
kept the lines of communication open via email and text messages
